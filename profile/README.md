 # Noriu

  **Stop fighting your brain.**

  We're building a productivity app for ADHD brains. Not another to-do list that makes you feel bad about yesterday. Something that actually works with how your mind operates.

  ## The Problem

  Traditional productivity apps assume you have perfect memory, consistent energy, and respond well to shame. They fail most people within 30 days.

  We're different. No overdue lists. No streaks. No guilt. Just a fresh start, every time.

  ## Free Tools

  Try these now, no signup required:

  🍕 **[Dopamine Menu Builder](https://noriu.app/tools/dopamine-menu)** — Build a Dopamine Menu for ADHD brains. Quick, productive tasks organized by energy.
  
  ⏱️ **[Focus Timer](https://noriu.app/tools/focus-timer)** — Simple, distraction-free timer. Time your work or your Dopamine Menu activities.

  ## What We're Building

  The full Noriu app — coming soon:
  
  - **Nori** — A quiet companion that's there when you need, invisible when you don't
  - **"What Now?"** — When you're stuck, we pick ONE thing for you
  - **Energy matching** — Tasks that fit how you actually feel right now
  - **Celebrate small wins** — Because "done" deserves a moment, even if it's just one thing
  - **And much more** — Voice brain dumps, rescue my day, morning kickstart, and beyond

  ## Built by ADHD brains, for ADHD brains

  We get it. We've abandoned the same apps you have.
